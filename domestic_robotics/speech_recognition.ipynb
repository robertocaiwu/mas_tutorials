    "# Speech recognition tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Our speech module is much smaller compared to other components such as perception. However, it plays an important role in enabling human-machine interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on the implementation of speech recognition that is currently being used by the @Home team, which relies on [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition), which is a python library that supports several online and offline speech recognition engines and APIs. Additionally, this tutorial will also cover __Kaldi__ and how it was integrated into the speech recognition pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial depends on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition)\n",
    "    - CMU's [PocketSphinx](https://pypi.org/project/pocketsphinx/) for offline speech recognition (Optionally, in case you do not want to use Google Speech) \n",
    "- [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) - speech recognition toolkit\n",
    "- [py-kaldi-asr](https://github.com/gooofy/py-kaldi-asr) - a python wrapper for Kaldi\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of speech recognition is to record speech in the form of a sound wave and convert it into a digital representation of the wave. Once we have this audio data, we can use it as input to a model to transcribe the audio into text. I will not delve into what tipes of models since it is not the focus of the tutorial, but keep in mind that there are several existing API's using SOA methods (Google for online and Kaldi for offline in this case). \n",
